A simple example demonstrating how a static configuration changes a 
behaviour depending on settings. The downside of the approach is that each 
time a property is changed the application must be redeployed. It's a 
slower process since a decent amount of time would be devoted to a code review.

On the other hand a dynamic configuration allows users to get changes on 
fly providing more power and flexibility. However it's a more risky approach.
A necessary result may be achieved with the click of a button.
