The most basic live chat demonstrating polling and streaming simultaneously;

Before running the app install all dependencies `npm install`

Split your terminal window into 3 windows;

In one of them run first a server `npm run server`, then in another terminal 
execute `npm run stream` and finally, in the third window type `npm run 
poll` and hit enter.

Send messages between two clients. Polling has a 3 seconds delay. Streaming 
receives messages instantaneously.
